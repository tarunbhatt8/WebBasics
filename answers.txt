Q.1- What is an access token? Generate your access token for any API.(for example Twitter,Spotify etc).

An access token is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.

The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that requires privileges. Access tokens contain the following information:

* The security identifier (SID) for the user's account
* SIDs for the groups of which the user is a member
* A logon SID that identifies the current logon session
* A list of the privileges held by either the user or the user's groups
* An owner SID
* The SID for the primary group
* the default DACL that the system uses when the user creates a securable object * without specifying a security descriptor
* The source of the access token
* Whether the token is a primary or impersonation token
* An optional list of restricting SIDs
* Current impersonation levels
* Other statistics


//I GENERATED ACCESS TOKEN FOR FACEBOO API, USING FOLLOWING STEPS:

open facebook developers>>> tools>>>graph API explorer

click on get Access Token>> select permissions >> click on get access token

login when askded for >> copy the access token

//my access token that i generated was:

Q.2- Get the IP address of some common sites like Google, Facebook by using DNS lookup.

google.com: 216.58.196.206
facebook.com: 157.240.13.35
acadview.com: 52.37.66.135
github.com: 192.30.253.112
spotify.com: 104.199.64.136



Q.3- Using Tweepy library try to extract tweets from Twitter.



Q.4- What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with examples.

A Library is a chunk of code that you can call from your own code, to help you do things more quickly/easily. 
For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all that code for yourself.A library performs specific, well-defined operations.

An API (application programming interface) is a term meaning the functions/methods in a library that you can call to ask it to do things for you - the interface to the library.
An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program without having direct access.
A web API is collection of web urls which is a bridge between two applications.

Example:  Scrapy is a library in Python. If you are involved in webscraping then this is a must have library for you.

Example:  NumPy is a library in Python. It provides some advance math functionalities to python.

Example: OLA using Google Maps API for navigation

Example : Amazon : Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more released its API so that Web site developers could more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a third party Web site can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and an option to "buy now."


Q.5- Try to access Spotify API . Find out some library for it and play some music.

Spotify is not Available currently for Indian Users.
However, I signed up using Great Britain Proxy.
My username is 1ssuv6ezm4gfxn32zmtzrf3ps
